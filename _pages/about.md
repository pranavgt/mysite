As a Wharton Economics senior with a Computer Science minor, I operate at the intersection of <b>math, markets, and code</b> to build high-performance systems and analytics. I translate complex data into practical, scalable solutions that serve real customers.

My current research, under the guidance of <a href="https://gileshooker.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Giles Hooker</a>, explores how <b>graph databases and ontologies</b> can be leveraged within AI/ML frameworks to build more <a>reliable and auditable</a> systems for regulatory and trade compliance.

I have built and deployed performant, scalable production systems. At <a href="https://www.flagright.com/" target="_blank">Flagright</a>  a Y Combinator-backed fintech, I engineered and deployed a Node.js sanctions-screening microservice on AWS. This system supported over 25,000 daily transactions with sub-800ms P95 latency. 

My passion lies in building efficient, data-driven solutions. Recent projects include a hybrid graph-document store that achieved 92% top-K recall and cut query time by 38%, and a real-time sanctions detector that alerts in under a second. I have a diverse and growing toolkit : from Python and Java to AWS and GCP . learn diverse technologies quickly. My strength lies in my ability to rapidly learn and apply new technologies with precision.
